# FrogProblemSim
 Simulator for the Frog Problem
 as presented by Matt Parker in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLTyX4zL2Fc)
 
 Runs multithreaded for runs over 1000 simulations.
 Lets you select a range of sizes for the pond (how many lily pads).
 Lets you choose how many simulations to run for each pond in multiples of 1000.
 
### Instructions.
 1. Open in Visual Studio (or run exe).
 2. Run.
 3. Input the lower bound of the pond size (eg. 2).
 4. Input the upper bound of the pond size (eg 1000).
 5. Input the number of 1000 simulations per pond. (ie. if you want 1 million simulations then enter 1000, as 1000 * 1000 == 1,000,000).
 6. Opt to output to a csv file, select a filename and choose to output to the screen as well.
 7. Let the simulation run.
 8. Analyse the results.
